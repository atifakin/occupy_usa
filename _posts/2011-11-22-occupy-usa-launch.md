**Nov 21, 2011**

The goal of this project is to help visualize data about the #Occupy movement. My hope is for this to become a collective project that tells the heroic story of the 99% in struggle against the exploitation and repression of the 1%.

There are already a couple of mapping projects out there about Occupy, so why another one?

- This project is open source. Anyone can contribute to it on [Github](https://github.com/kostajh/occupy_usa)
- Other Occupy maps are geared at showing the current state of the movement. My hope is that this project focuses on bringing in open data on unemployment, inequality indexes, demographics, and other metrics to tell some stories about why #Occupy is evolving the way it is.
- I wanted a beautiful map. Google Maps just doesn't cut it!

### How this project was built

The data was originally pulled from [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/oct/18/occupy-protests-map-world). They've done a terrific job of collecting the data. This project is focused on the U.S. however.

The spreadsheet of data was tidied up and imported to [TileMill](https://www.tilemill.com), an open source mapping tool. The map tiles themselves are temporarily hosted on [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com), if you'd like to donate to help keep them there, please [contact me](/contact.html).

### How you can help

There are a number of cities not represented on the map. Please [submit data](/submit.html) for these locations or send corrections for existing ones.

If you would like to help add overlays of data to the map, or assist with the website, please fork the project on [Github](https://github.com/kostajh/occupy_usa) or file an issue over there.

Onwards,

Kosta
